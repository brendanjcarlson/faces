# SMILE! OR not :'(

# Write a function that returns a list or a tuple of the number of smiley faces and the number of sad faces in a string.
# A smiley face looks like -->   :) or :D
# A sad face looks like -->   :( or :'(

# Limitations: You cannot use the count method.


# Examples:
# solution("Hello there:) I'm a smiley face:) but sometimes I get sad :(. I'm usually really happy! :D") --> 3, 1
# solution("I'm a sad face :(, this is my brother smiley face :) my cousins are crying face :'( and oddly-always-too-happy-face :D") --> 2, 2
